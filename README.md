# HOLYTASK — AI-powered Task Tracker

Task tracker for engineering teams with an embedded AI agent layer that eliminates daily planning friction.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd holytasker
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). On first run, 10 realistic seed tasks are inserted automatically.

**To enable AI features:** Open **Settings** (top right) → AI Providers → paste your API key → Save → set as Active. Without a key, the app runs normally but all AI buttons are visually disabled with a tooltip.

## Storage: SQLite via better-sqlite3

**Why SQLite:** Persistent across restarts, no external server, synchronous API (cleaner code at this scale), full SQL for filtering and sorting. Database lives at `data/devlog.db`.

**Schema includes:**
- `tasks` — core task data with status, priority, assignee
- `subtasks` — checklist items with cascade delete
- `agent_runs` — every AI agent execution with step-level tool call tracing
- `task_comments` — threaded discussion on tasks
- `task_reactions` / `comment_reactions` — emoji reactions
- `ai_settings` — per-user AI provider API keys and active selection
- `user_integrations` — Slack OAuth tokens

**Limitations:** Not suitable for horizontal scaling (single-writer). Production path: PostgreSQL.

## AI Features

### A. Prioritization Agent

Analyzes all active tasks and recommends what to work on today with explicit reasoning. **Genuine multi-step agent, not a single LLM call:**

1. `list_active_tasks` → all todo/in-progress tasks
2. `score_task(id)` for each → server computes `age_hours × priority_weight × status_weight`
3. `get_task_details(id)` for top candidates → full context including subtasks
4. Returns top-3 ranked with per-task reasoning + overall summary

**Key design:** Scoring is deterministic on the server — avoids hallucinated math. The LLM receives pre-computed scores and provides human-readable reasoning. Every run logged to `agent_runs` with all tool calls, latency, and user acceptance.

### B. Decomposition Agent

Generates structured subtasks from a task title and description. **Two-branch flow based on clarity assessment:**

**Vague task (clarity score < 0.65):**
→ `get_task_details` → `assess_clarity` → returns clarifying questions → user answers → retry → `get_similar_tasks` → generate → `validate_subtasks` → preview

**Clear task (clarity score ≥ 0.65):**
→ `get_task_details` → `assess_clarity` → `get_similar_tasks` → generate → `validate_subtasks` → preview

The 0.65 threshold is deliberately conservative: it triggers only when description is missing key signals (action verbs, technical scope, acceptance criteria). The conditional branch is the core proof of agentness — not just a linear sequence of calls.

**Preview before write:** subtasks shown as editable list. DB write happens only after explicit user confirmation.

### C. Status Update Generator

Generates a concise async Slack-style update from the current task state. Accessible via **Send to Slack → ✦ Generate status update**. **Multi-step agent:**

1. `get_task_details` → title, description, status, priority, assignee
2. `get_subtask_progress` → how many subtasks done vs. remaining
3. `get_recent_comments` → latest thread context (blockers, notes)
4. Composes a 2-4 line update with appropriate emoji and tone

Example output: *"🔄 Working on JWT refresh token rotation — 5/8 subtasks done. Currently implementing the token revocation logic. On track for today."*

### D. AI Chat Assistant (Custom)

Embedded streaming chat in the right panel. Has full context of all tasks at every message — status, priority, age, subtask progress. Useful for: standup updates, "what's blocked?", "explain task X", writing subtask acceptance criteria.

Built with Anthropic streaming API (`streamChatCompletion`). Supports 5 providers via settings: Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, Google Gemini.

## Extended Features (beyond brief scope)

Built after the core requirements were met:

- **Task comments** — threaded discussion with emoji reactions on each task
- **Send to Slack** — posts formatted task summary to any Slack channel or DM
- **Multi-provider AI** — configure API keys for 5 LLM providers in Settings; one active at a time

## AI Provider Configuration

HOLYTASK supports **5 AI providers** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Mistral, and Google Gemini. Switching providers is a first-class feature, not an afterthought: it's designed so teams can bring their own keys without touching config files.

**Two ways to configure:**

**1. Settings UI (recommended for interactive use)**  
Open **Settings** → AI Providers → paste key → Save → set Active. Keys are stored locally in the SQLite database. The active provider powers all agents and the chat panel.

**2. Environment variables (recommended for scripted/CI setups)**  
Add to `.env.local`. The env key acts as a fallback when no provider is active in Settings:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...   # recommended — full agent support
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIza...
```

Both approaches coexist: Settings takes precedence, env is the fallback. See `.env.example` for all supported variables.

> **Note on security:** Keys configured via Settings are stored as plain text in `data/devlog.db`. For a local dev tool this is acceptable — the threat model is the same as `.env.local`. A production version would encrypt keys at rest before storing.

## Environment Variables

No env vars are required. Only Slack integration needs credentials configured via `.env.local` (see `.env.example`).

## Known Limitations

- **Single-writer SQLite** — acceptable for stated scope (one user, local dev)
- **No real-time sync** — list refreshes on mutations, not WebSocket
- **Clarity assessment is heuristic** — keyword-based, not semantic. May trigger clarification for edge-case tasks near the 0.65 threshold. Acknowledged trade-off documented in `AGENT_LOG.md`
- **AI latency 3-10s** — loading states shown throughout
- **Single-user mode** — no auth required; the app works for one user out of the box
